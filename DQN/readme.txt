Getting started:

- run the 'Installing Dependencies' section to install all the relavant libraries
and then retart the runtime.

- additionally you may want to have the following libraries installed: torch, 
numpy, matplotlib, gym==0.25.2 and pandas.

- if you are using google colab you can run the 'Drive connect' section to mount
drive and then upload the RL_Project folder to this directory:
'/content/drive/MyDrive/'

- if you are not using colab then change the PATH variable at the top of the 
Global variables section to whichever relevant directory applies to you and do 
not attempt to mount drive.

- You need to use GPU in order to run this notebook.

- After installing the required dependencies and restarting the runtime, you can
run all the sections starting from Global variables to the end sequentially.
